These are the imagebuilder script which are bound to replace make goals that
build images in an effort to remove any calls to the build system when creating
images. As of now we still have to call the build system in corresponding cases
in order to create proper bootstrap images for the selected platforms which
however only has to done once. Subsequent calls to these imagebuilder scripts
will rely on the l4image tool to build the final image including the selected
modules.
